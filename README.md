# 📦 Vendor Performance Analysis Project

Vendor Performance Analysis involves systematically evaluating how effectively suppliers contribute to an organization’s success. This includes assessing key factors such as product quality, cost efficiency, delivery timeliness, reliability, and the overall value they provide.

## Business Problem

Companies often face losses due to poor inventory practices, inefficient pricing strategies, and vendor over-dependence. This analysis aims to:

- Identify underperforming brands needing promotional or pricing adjustments.
- Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
- Analyze the effect of bulk purchasing on unit cost.
- Assess inventory turnover to improve efficiency and reduce holding costs.
- Investigate profitability variance between high- and low-performing vendors

## Tools & Technologies

| Tool        | Purpose                         |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Python**  | Data analysis & scripting        |
| **Pandas**  | Data manipulation                |
| **SQL**     | Data extraction from SQLite      |
| **Power BI**| Dashboard creation               |
| **Jupyter** | EDA & visualization              |
| **Matplotlib/Seaborn** | Visual analytics     |

## Database Connection

To run the analysis, establish a connection to the SQLite database:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Create a SQLAlchemy engine to connect to the SQLite database named 'inventory.db'
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///inventory.db')

# Connect to the SQLite database file
conn = sqlite3.connect('inventory.db')

# Checking tables present in the database
tables = pd.read_sql_query(
    "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master
     WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name ASC", conn
)
tables


```

## Data Aggregation using SQL (Final Query)
The query below creates the final `vendor_sales_summary` by joining purchase, sales, and freight data using Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

```python
vendor_sales_summary = pd.read_sql_query("""
WITH FreightSummary AS (
    SELECT
        VendorNumber, 
        SUM(Freight) AS FreightCost 
    FROM vendor_invoice
    GROUP BY VendorNumber
), 
PurchaseSummary AS (
    SELECT
        p.VendorNumber,
        p.VendorName,
        p.Brand, 
        p.Description, 
        p.PurchasePrice, 
        pp.Volume, 
        pp.Price AS ActualPrice,
        SUM(p.Quantity) AS TotalPurchaseQuantity,
        SUM(p.Dollars) AS TotalPurchaseDollars
    FROM purchases p
    JOIN purchase_prices pp
        ON p.Brand = pp.Brand
    WHERE p.PurchasePrice > 0
    GROUP BY 
        p.VendorNumber, p.VendorName, p.Brand, p.Description, p.PurchasePrice, pp.Price, pp.Volume
),
SalesSummary AS (
    SELECT 
        VendorNo, 
        Brand, 
        SUM(SalesDollars) AS TotalSalesDollars,
        SUM(SalesPrice) AS TotalSalesPrice,
        SUM(SalesQuantity) AS TotalSalesQuantity,
        SUM(ExciseTax) AS TotalExciseTax
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY VendorNo, Brand
)
SELECT 
    ps.VendorNumber,
    ps.VendorName, 
    ps.Brand,
    ps.Description, 
    ps.PurchasePrice, 
    ps.ActualPrice,
    ps.Volume, 
    ps.TotalPurchaseQuantity, 
    ps.TotalPurchaseDollars,
    ss.TotalSalesQuantity,
    ss.TotalSalesDollars,
    ss.TotalSalesPrice,
    ss.TotalExciseTax,
    fs.FreightCost
FROM PurchaseSummary ps 
LEFT JOIN SalesSummary ss
    ON ps.VendorNumber = ss.VendorNo
    AND ps.Brand = ss.Brand
LEFT JOIN FreightSummary fs
    ON ps.VendorNumber = fs.VendorNumber
ORDER BY ps.TotalPurchaseDollars DESC
""", conn)

```
